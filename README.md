# Cms

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## API

Run `node server.js` in a separate terminal to run the API server. The frontend won't work right without it.
You'll need to add a .env file with your mongodb connection string. Add this line:
`MONGODB_URI=<your connection string here>`
